<p>This announcement marked the abrupt end of a VPS provider that had appeared promising—at least at first glance.</p>
<p>Back in September, I signed up for a Slicehosting VPS plan because they offered a deal that seemed too good to pass up. The service had even been mentioned on <a href="https://lowendbox.com/blog/did-you-miss-slicehostings-offer-in-june-theyve-restocked-cheap-vps-in-frankfurt-and-mumbai-starting-with-16gb-ram-for-6-month/">LowEndBox</a>, lending it some credibility. However, as things turned out, Slicehosting has joined the ranks of fly-by-night VPS providers.</p>
<p>Here’s the plan I got:</p>
