[{"content":"\n## Introduction\n**Resilio Sync** is a file synchronization software that uses peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to share and sync files across devices. It enables secure, fast, and efficient file transfers by leveraging the BitTorrent protocol. Resilio Sync allows users to create shared folders or \"syncs,\" which are encrypted and accessible only to devices with the unique access key. Key features include real-time updates, no file size limits, cross-platform compatibility, and the ability to sync files without relying on cloud storage providers, ensuring privacy and control over data. It is commonly used for personal backups, team collaboration, and large-scale file distribution.\n\n## `compose.yml`\n```yml\nservices:\n  resilio-sync:\n    image: linuxserver/resilio-sync\n    container_name: resilio-sync\n    environment:\n      - PUID=1000\n      - PGID=1000\n      - TZ=Asia/Manila\n    volumes:\n      - ./config:/config\n      - ./downloads:/downloads\n    ports:\n#      - 8888:8888 # web GUI, to be proxied via caddy\n      - 55555:55555\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    networks:\n      - caddynetwork\n\nnetworks:\n  caddynetwork:\n    external: true\n```\n\n### Notes\n- Make sure to have already created the `caddynetwork` with `docker network create caddynetwork`\n- Container port `8888` is proxied via `caddy`\n- Change `PUID`, `PGID`, and `TZ` to what is applicable to your setup\n- The first time you spin up the container and access the site, you will be prompted to create your `username` and `password`\n\n## `Caddyfile`\n```caddy\nsync.deuts.org {\n  reverse_proxy resilio-sync:8888\n}\n```","params":{"apps":["resilio-sync","caddy"],"date":"2024-11-15T13:33:00+08:00","description":"Resilio Sync offers fast, secure file synchronization using peer-to-peer technology.

You can easily nest ideas and create structured content without worrying about formatting.\n\n- **Bidirectional Linking by Default** - While Obsidian has backlinks, Logseq treats every reference as truly bidirectional, making connections between ideas more seamless.\n\n- **Daily Notes as Standard** - Logseq automatically creates daily journals, encouraging regular documentation and making it easier to track thoughts chronologically.\n\n- **Open Source Philosophy** - Logseq is fully open-source, which means greater transparency and community involvement in its development.\n\n- **Graph Database Backend** - The underlying architecture makes complex queries and connections between your notes more powerful.\n\n- **Block References** - You can reference and embed specific blocks (not just pages) throughout your notes, creating more granular connections.\n\n- **Task Management Built-In** - Logseq has robust task management features with TODO states, priorities, and deadlines integrated directly into your notes.\n\n-  **Whiteboarding Capabilities** - Recent updates have added excellent whiteboarding features that combine well with the outliner approach.\n\n### Summary Comparison\n\n| Feature | Logseq | Obsidian |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| Core Structure | Outliner-based (bullet points) | Document-based (markdown files) |\n| Linking | Bidirectional by default | Backlinks as a feature |\n| Daily Notes | Automatically created and integrated | Available as a plugin |\n| Source Code | Fully open-source | Closed source with open plugin API |\n| Backend | Graph database | File-based system |\n| Referencing | Block-level references | Page-level references primarily |\n| Task Management | Built-in TODO system with states | Requires plugins for robust task management |\n| Whiteboarding | Integrated whiteboard capabilities | Available through plugins |\n| Data Storage | Local plain text files (.md/.org) | Local plain text files (.md) |\n| Pricing | Free, open-source | Free core, paid sync service |\n\n### Where Obsidian Still Shines\nIt's important to acknowledge Obsidian's strengths that make this decision difficult:\n\n- **Mature plugin ecosystem:** Thousands of community plugins for customization\n- **Document-centric approach:** Better for long-form writing and publishing\n- **Performance with large vaults:** Generally handles massive collections better\n- **Polished UI/UX:** More refined interface and smoother experience\n- **Themes and customization:** More options for personalizing appearance\n- **Mobile experience:** Generally considered more mature on mobile devices\n\n### Conclusion\nFor now, my priority is mature ecosystem, document-centric approach, and polished experienced. Thus, Obsidian it is.","params":{"apps":["logseq","obsidian"],"cover":{"image":"logseq-obsidian.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2025-03-04T23:28:25+08:00","description":"Logseq provides an intuitive outliner-first experience, seamless bidirectional linking, and powerful task management—all in an open-source package.

However, selecting between a **SharePoint folder (document library)** and a **SharePoint list** can significantly impact performance and functionality. This post explores the key differences and limitations when using a **SharePoint folder** compared to a **SharePoint list** in Power Apps.  \n\n## **1. Delegation Limits**  \nPower Apps supports **delegation** for SharePoint **lists**, allowing queries to be processed on the backend rather than locally on the device. However, **SharePoint folders (document libraries) do not support delegation**, meaning:  \n- Power Apps retrieves only a limited number of files (default: **500**, max: **2,000**).  \n- Queries on large document libraries can lead to **performance issues**.  \n\nIf you need to work with thousands of records, a SharePoint **list** is the better choice.  \n\n## **2. Filtering \u0026 Sorting**  \n- In **SharePoint lists**, filtering and sorting are handled on the backend, making them efficient.  \n- In **SharePoint folders**, Power Apps processes filtering and sorting **client-side**, which slows down performance if the library contains many files.  \n\n## **3. No Patch() Support**  \nThe `Patch()` function in Power Apps allows direct updates to **SharePoint lists**, making it easy to modify data without additional automation. Unfortunately, **SharePoint folders do not support `Patch()`**, meaning:  \n- You **cannot update metadata** (e.g., file status, category) directly from Power Apps.  \n- Workarounds require **Power Automate** to handle updates via flows.  \n\n## **4. Limited File Handling**  \nPower Apps can **list files** from a SharePoint folder but has no built-in file management capabilities. You **cannot**:  \n- Move files between folders.  \n- Rename or delete files within Power Apps.  \n\nInstead, you need **Power Automate** for these actions.  \n\n## **5. Performance Issues with Large Libraries**  \nSharePoint has a **list view threshold** of **5,000 items**, affecting document libraries with thousands of files. While SharePoint lists allow indexed columns and views to optimize performance, document libraries often require workarounds, such as filtering by folders or using indexed metadata columns.  \n\n## **6. Metadata Handling**  \n- **SharePoint lists** have structured columns, relationships, and lookups, making data manipulation easier.  \n- **SharePoint folders** store metadata, but accessing and modifying it from Power Apps requires additional effort.  \n\n## **When to Use SharePoint Lists vs. Folders in Power Apps**  \n| Feature | SharePoint List | SharePoint Folder (Document Library) |  \n|---------|----------------|--------------------------------------|  \n| Delegation | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |  \n| Filtering \u0026 Sorting | ✅ Efficient | ❌ Slower (Client-side) |  \n| Supports `Patch()` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |  \n| File Management | ❌ No files, only data | ❌ Limited (No move/rename/delete) |  \n| Large Data Support | ✅ Optimized with indexes | ❌ Performance issues with \u003e5,000 files |  \n| Metadata Handling | ✅ Structured \u0026 easy to update | ❌ Requires Power Automate for updates |  \n\n### **Final Thoughts**  \nIf your Power Apps solution requires **structured data**, complex filtering, and efficient data management, a **SharePoint list** is the best choice. However, if you need to work with **files**, be prepared for **limitations in filtering, sorting, and metadata updates** when using a SharePoint folder.  \n\nFor advanced file handling, consider integrating **Power Automate** to manage document library operations while using Power Apps for display and interaction.

This can be caused by either browser caching or server-side caching mechanisms.\n\nTo ensure you're always getting the latest version of your file, you can append a random query parameter to the file URL. This forces Power Query to treat each request as unique, bypassing any cached versions.\n\n### Solution\n\nUse the following Power Query (M) script:\n\n```powerquery\nlet\n     Source = Csv.Document(Web.Contents(\"https://example.domain.com/file.csv?\" \u0026 Number.ToText(Number.RoundDown(Number.RandomBetween(1, 1000000)))),\n         [Delimiter=\",\", Encoding=65001, QuoteStyle=QuoteStyle.None]),\n     #\"Promoted Headers\" = Table.PromoteHeaders(Source, [PromoteAllScalars=true])\n in\n     #\"Promoted Headers\"\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n- The `Web.Contents` function fetches the CSV file from the provided URL.\n- The `Number.RandomBetween(1, 1000000)` generates a random number.\n- This random number is appended as a query parameter, ensuring each request is treated as a unique request by the server.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- Prevents stale data from being loaded due to caching.\n- Ensures your Power Query reports always reflect the latest file updates.\n- Works seamlessly without needing server-side changes.\n\nBy implementing this approach, you can confidently refresh your Power Query data without worrying about outdated cached files.","params":{"cover":{"image":"powerquery-bypass-cache.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2025-02-19T08:54:57+08:00","description":"A simple method to ensure that Power Query fetches the latest file version by appending a random query string to the URL.","draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2025-02-19T08:54:57+08:00","publishdate":"2025-02-19T08:54:57+08:00","slug":"powerquery-bypass-cache","summary":"Learn how to bypass browser and server caching when fetching files in Power Query.","tags":["power-query","cache"],"title":"Ensuring Updated Files in Power Query Without Cache Conflicts"},"permalink":"https://deuts.org/p/powerquery-bypass-cache/","title":"Ensuring Updated Files in Power Query Without Cache Conflicts"},{"content":"\n[#BDO](https://fediwall.social/?tags=BDO\u0026accounts=\u0026lang=en\u0026title=%23BDO) now has a new online online banking website, the functionality of which is pretty much like its mobile app --\u003e No Trust Accounts view or transactions (yet?).

Here are two techniques I learned from the above video.  \n\n### 1. Custom Sorting in Power Query  \n\nBy default, Power Query sorts data in ascending or descending order, but what if you need a custom order? For example, let’s say you have ratings labeled as **E, A, B**, and you want them sorted in that specific sequence. You can achieve this using the `List.PositionOf` function:  \n\n```powerquery\n= Table.Sort(Source, {each List.PositionOf({\"E\", \"A\", \"B\"}, [Ratings])})\n```  \n\nThis method allows you to define an arbitrary order and sort the table accordingly. It’s especially useful when dealing with categorical data that doesn’t follow a standard numerical or alphabetical order.  \n\n### 2. The Error Trick – Filtering Non-Date Values  \n\nSometimes, a dataset contains values that cannot be converted into a date. Instead of manually checking for errors, you can use the `try` function to filter out non-date values:  \n\n```powerquery\n= List.Select(Source, each (try Date.From(\"1\" \u0026 _))[HasError])\n```  \n\nThis formula attempts to convert each value into a date by prefixing it with \"1\" (to ensure a valid month-day format). If the conversion fails, the `[HasError]` property will be `true`, meaning the value is **not** a valid date. This trick helps you quickly identify and isolate (or keep, depending on your use case) problematic data.

This Power Query function helps determine the next available banking day when given a date input. It skips weekends and holidays, ensuring that the returned date is a valid working day.  \n\n## How the Function Works  \n\n1. **Check for Non-Banking Days**  \n   - The function `IsNonBankingDay` determines if a given date falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) or is a holiday (from a predefined list).  \n\n2. **Find the Next Banking Day**  \n   - If the input date is a non-banking day, the function `GetNextBankingDay` recursively moves to the next day until it finds a valid banking day.  \n\n3. **Return the Result**  \n   - If the input date is already a banking day, it is returned unchanged. Otherwise, the function finds and returns the next available banking day.  \n\n## Power Query Code  \n\n```powerquery\n(inputDate as date) =\u003e\nlet\n    // Helper function to check if a date is a non-banking day\n    IsNonBankingDay = (dateToCheck as date) =\u003e \n        let\n            IsHoliday = List.Contains(Holidays, dateToCheck),\n            IsWeekend = Date.DayOfWeek(dateToCheck, Day.Monday) \u003e= 5\n        in \n            IsHoliday or IsWeekend,\n\n    // Recursive function to find next banking day\n    GetNextBankingDay = (dateToCheck as date) =\u003e\n        let\n            NextDay = Date.AddDays(dateToCheck, 1)\n        in\n            if IsNonBankingDay(NextDay) then\n                @GetNextBankingDay(NextDay)\n            else\n                NextDay,\n\n    // Main logic\n    outputDate = if IsNonBankingDay(inputDate) \n                     then GetNextBankingDay(inputDate) \n                     else inputDate\nin\n    outputDate\n```\n\nNote: it is important that you have a query called `Holidays` which is a list of all holidays for the date range that covers your `inputDate`.\n\n### Recursive Function Call\nIn Power Query M language, the `@` symbol is used for recursive function calls. It's a self-reference operator that allows a function to call itself.\n\nWhen you use `@GetNextBankingDay`, you're explicitly telling Power Query that you want to call the same function recursively. It's similar to how you might use `this` in other programming languages to refer to the current instance.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n```powerquery\nGetNextBankingDay = (dateToCheck as date) =\u003e\n    let\n        NextDay = Date.AddDays(dateToCheck, 1)\n    in\n        if IsNonBankingDay(NextDay) then\n            @GetNextBankingDay(NextDay)  // Recursive call to the same function\n            //^ The @ here means \"this same function\"\n        else\n            NextDay\n```\n\nWithout the `@`, Power Query wouldn't know you're trying to make a recursive call to the same function you're currently defining. The `@` symbol makes this explicit and helps avoid any ambiguity, especially in cases where you might have functions with the same name in different scopes.\n\nIt's worth noting that while recursion is powerful, you should be careful with it as Power Query has limitations on recursion depth to prevent infinite loops.\n\n## Example Usage  \n\nIf `Holidays = {#date(2024, 1, 1), #date(2024, 12, 25)}` and you input:  \n\n- `#date(2024, 1, 1) (New Year's Day - a holiday)` → Returns `#date(2024, 1, 2)`  \n- `#date(2024, 6, 15) (Saturday)` → Returns `#date(2024, 6, 17)`  \n- `#date(2024, 6, 18) (Tuesday)` → Returns `#date(2024, 6, 18)` (already a banking day)  \n\n## Why Use This Function?  \n\n- **Automates Banking Date Calculations** – No need to manually adjust dates for non-working days.  \n- **Ensures Accuracy in Financial Reports** – Prevents transactions from being scheduled on closed banking days.  \n- **Handles Custom Holiday Lists** – Can be adapted to specific regional or company-defined holidays.  \n\nThis function is useful in scenarios such as payment processing, interest calculations, or any business process that relies on valid banking days.","params":{"cover":{"image":"banking-days.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2025-02-05T17:46:27+08:00","description":"This Power Query function determines the next banking day by skipping weekends and predefined holidays.

While both languages share similar concepts for organizing data, their syntax and the way they handle data structures differ significantly.\n\nLet's compare the basic data structures of lists and dictionaries in Python with their counterparts in Power Query: lists and records.\n\n### What is a List?\n\nA **list** is an ordered collection of items. Both Python and Power Query support lists, but they are defined differently in each language.\n\n#### Python List\nIn Python, a list is defined using **square brackets `[]`**. It can contain any type of data—integers, strings, or even other lists.\n\n##### Example:\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, \"apple\"]\nprint(my_list)\n```\nOutput:\n```\n[1, 2, 3, 'apple']\n```\n\n- Lists in Python are **ordered** and **mutable**, meaning you can change their contents after creation.\n- Lists are useful for storing collections of items in a specific order.\n\n#### Power Query List\nIn Power Query, a **list** is defined using **curly braces `{}`**. Like Python lists, Power Query lists can store items of different types.\n\n##### Example:\n```m\nmyList = {1, 2, 3, \"apple\"}\n```\n\n- Power Query lists are **ordered** and can contain various data types.\n- Lists in Power Query are often used for operations like filtering, combining, or applying functions to the list's items.\n\n### What is a Dictionary/Record?\n\nA **dictionary** (in Python) or a **record** (in Power Query) is a collection of **key-value pairs**. They allow you to store data in a way that you can easily look up a value by its corresponding key.\n\n#### Python Dictionary\nIn Python, a **dictionary** is defined using **curly braces `{}`**, with **key-value pairs** separated by a colon `:`.\n\n##### Example:\n```python\nmy_dict = {\"title\": \"Task 1\", \"slug\": \"task-1\"}\nprint(my_dict)\n```\nOutput:\n```\n{'title': 'Task 1', 'slug': 'task-1'}\n```\n\n- Dictionaries in Python are **unordered** (before Python 3.7) and **mutable**.\n- You can access a value using its key:\n  ```python\n  print(my_dict[\"title\"])  # Outputs: Task 1\n  ```\n\n#### Power Query Record\nIn Power Query, a **record** is similar to a dictionary, but it's defined using **square brackets `[]`** and **field-value pairs**.\n\n##### Example:\n```m\nmyRecord = [title = \"Task 1\", slug = \"task-1\"]\n```\n\n- Power Query **records** store **field-value pairs**, similar to Python's dictionaries.\n- Records are commonly used when you need to structure data with labels, such as metadata or configuration settings.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n| Concept              | Python                            | Power Query                        |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **List**             | Defined with **`[]`**. Stores ordered data. | Defined with **`{}`**. Stores ordered data. |\n| **Dictionary/Record**| Defined with **`{}`**. Stores key-value pairs. | Defined with **`[]`**. Stores field-value pairs. |\n| **Mutability**       | Both lists and dictionaries are **mutable**. | Both lists and records are **mutable**. |\n| **Ordering**         | Lists are ordered. Dictionaries are unordered (before Python 3.7). | Lists are ordered. Records don't have inherent order. |\n| **Accessing Values** | Use index for lists, and key for dictionaries. | Use index for lists, and field names for records. |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile Python and Power Query use different syntax to define their data structures, the concepts of **lists** and **dictionaries/records** are quite similar. Lists are used for ordered collections of data, and dictionaries (or records in Power Query) are used for storing key-value pairs.\n\n- **In Python**, use `[]` for lists and `{}` for dictionaries.\n- **In Power Query**, use `{}` for lists and `[]` for records.\n\nUnderstanding the similarities and differences between these data structures is crucial for working efficiently in both environments. I hope this comparison has helped clarify how to work with lists and dictionaries (or records) in Python and Power Query!","params":{"cover":{"image":"pypq-lists-records.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2025-02-05T09:42:15+08:00","description":"Python and Power Query are both powerful tools for data manipulation, but their syntax and data structures differ.

There are plenty of task management apps out there, but since I haven't yet found a good reason to pay for premium features, I've been sticking to the free versions. Here, I'll compare two popular options: **Remember The Milk (RTM)** and **Todoist**. \n\n## Why the Free Versions?\nI'm not against paying for apps. I just haven't seen enough value to justify the price yet. However, if I find an app truly compelling and invest significant time into it, I might upgrade in the future. For now, here's my take on how RTM and Todoist stack up.\n\n## Feature Comparison\n\n| Feature                       | RTM   | Todoist |\n|-------------------------------|-------|---------|\n| **Permalink to Task**         | ❌    | ✅      |\n| **Subtasks**                  | ❌    | ✅      |\n| **Natural Language Parsing**  | ✅    | ✅      |\n| **Keyboard Shortcuts**        | ✅    | ✅      |\n| **File Uploads**              | ❌    | ✅      |\n| **Filters/Smart Lists**       | ✅ *(No limit)* | ❌ *(3 max)* |\n| **Projects/Lists**            | ✅ *(No limit)* | ❌ *(5 max)* |\n\n### Key Observations\n\n- **Permalink to Tasks**:  \n  Todoist excels here, offering deep links to tasks. On mobile, it even opens directly in the app. This is great for quick access. RTM lacks this feature, which is a missed opportunity for seamless interaction.\n\n- **Subtasks**:  \n  Todoist supports subtasks even in its free version. RTM, unfortunately, does not.\n\n- **Community Support**:  \n  Todoist boasts a thriving Reddit community with 67K members, compared to RTM's modest 477. This disparity reflects RTM's slower development pace in recent years.\n\n- **API and Documentation**:  \n  Both apps have API rate limits that are quite similar. However, Todoist's API documentation feels more polished and beginner-friendly.\n\n- **Recurring Tasks**:  \n  Both RTM and Todoist handle recurring tasks correctly, treating each recurrence as a separate instance. This means that even if you postpone the current task or adjust its due date, the recurrence schedule remains unaffected—a behavior that some other task apps fail to implement properly.\n  \n- **Free Limits**:  \n  - Todoist caps free users at **3 filters**, while RTM allows unlimited smart lists.  \n  - Todoist also limits projects to 5, whereas RTM has no such restrictions.  \n\n- **Workflow Adjustments**:  \n  Switching from RTM to Todoist would mean adjusting my entire workflow. For example, RTM's **lists** are Todoist's **projects**, and tags differ in behavior. Todoist uses `#` for projects, while RTM uses `#` for tags. Keyboard shortcuts are also quite different.\n\n- **Task Limits**:  \n  Todoist has a 300 active tasks per project limit, which may not be an issue for most users, but it's worth noting for larger-scale planning. See also: [Usage limits in Todoists](https://todoist.com/help/articles/usage-limits-in-todoist-e5rcSY).\n\n## Final Thoughts\nBoth apps have strengths and weaknesses, depending on your needs. Todoist feels more polished overall, especially with its integration features and user-friendly design. However, RTM shines for its flexibility, unlimited lists, and smart lists without a paywall.\n\nWhile I'm still testing Todoist, RTM has been my go-to for years. Will I make the switch? Time will tell, but for now, I'll keep experimenting.","params":{"apps":["RememberTheMilk","Todoist"],"cover":{"image":"rtm-todoist.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2025-01-24T08:48:23+08:00","description":"A practical comparison between the free versions of Remember The Milk (RTM) and Todoist, exploring key features like recurring tasks, task limits, smart lists, and integrations to help users choose the best productivity tool.","draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2025-01-24T08:48:23+08:00","publishdate":"2025-01-24T08:48:23+08:00","slug":"rtm-vs-todoist-free","summary":"A comparison of the free versions of Remember The Milk (RTM) and Todoist, highlighting their features, limitations, and usability for task management enthusiasts.","tags":["productivity","task management"],"title":"RTM vs. Todoist: A Free User's Perspective"},"permalink":"https://deuts.org/p/rtm-vs-todoist-free/","title":"RTM vs. Todoist: A Free User's Perspective"},{"content":"{{\u003c linkding_title \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c linkding_description \u003e}}\nSome usage limits depend on your plan, while others apply to everyone.

While installing Hugo directly from GitHub is the best way to stay current, manually downloading the .deb package each time a new version is released can be a chore. Many users find themselves putting off updates, leaving Hugo outdated for longer than they'd like.\n\nThis simple script automates both the installation and updating of Hugo Extended to the latest version directly from GitHub. It checks if Hugo is installed, fetches the latest release, and installs it, all while eliminating the need for manual downloads or worrying about missing updates. It’s designed for the Hugo Extended amd64 Linux version but can be easily modified to suit different systems or versions.\n\n### The Script\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check if Hugo is installed by running `hugo version`\nHUGO_VERSION=$(hugo version 2\u003e/dev/null)\n\nif [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then\n    # If hugo is not installed, print the message\n    echo \"Hugo is not yet installed.\"\nelse\n    # If hugo is installed, display the current version\n    echo \"$HUGO_VERSION\"\nfi\n\n# Fetch the URL of the latest Hugo extended release for Linux (non-withdeploy version)\nHUGO_URL=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/gohugoio/hugo/releases/latest | \\\ngrep \"browser_download_url\" | grep \"hugo_extended\" | grep \"linux-amd64.deb\" | grep -v \"withdeploy\" | \\\nsed -E 's/.*\"([^\"]+)\".*/\\1/')\n\n# Check if the URL was successfully retrieved\nif [[ -z \"$HUGO_URL\" ]]; then\n    echo \"Error: Unable to retrieve the latest Hugo release URL.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Extract the filename from the URL (e.g., hugo_extended_0.140.2_linux-amd64.deb)\nFILE_NAME=$(basename \"$HUGO_URL\")\n\n# Prompt the user before downloading, based on whether Hugo is installed or not\nif [[ -z \"$HUGO_VERSION\" ]]; then\n    # If Hugo is not installed\n    echo -n \"Latest Hugo Extended version is $FILE_NAME. Do you want to download it? (y/n): \"\nelse\n    # If Hugo is installed\n    echo -n \"Latest Hugo Extended version is $FILE_NAME. Do you want to download it? (y/n): \"\nfi\n\nread -r RESPONSE\nif [[ \"$RESPONSE\" != \"y\" ]]; then\n    echo \"Download aborted.\"\n    exit 0\nfi\n\n# Download the latest Hugo .deb package with its original name\nwget -q \"$HUGO_URL\" -O \"$FILE_NAME\" || {\n    echo \"Error: Failed to download Hugo package.\"\n    exit 1\n}\n\n# Prompt the user before installing\necho -n \"Do you want to install the Hugo package $FILE_NAME? (y/n): \"\nread -r RESPONSE\nif [[ \"$RESPONSE\" != \"y\" ]]; then\n    echo \"Installation aborted.\"\n    exit 0\nfi\n\n# Install the downloaded Hugo package\nsudo dpkg -i \"$FILE_NAME\" || {\n    echo \"Error: Failed to install Hugo package.\"\n    exit 1\n}\n\n# Success message\necho \"Hugo package $FILE_NAME has been successfully installed.\"\nhugo version\n```\n### How to Use\n\n1. **Save and Make the Script Executable**  \n   Copy the script into a file (e.g., `update_hugo.sh`) and make it executable with:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x update_hugo.sh\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the Script**  \n   Execute the script with:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./update_hugo.sh\n   ```\n\n   The script will check if Hugo is installed, prompt you to download the latest version (which will be saved in the same directory as the script), and ask if you want to install it.\n\n3. **Verify Installation**  \n   Once installed, you can check the Hugo version with:\n\n   ```bash\n   hugo version\n   ```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis script automates Hugo updates, ensuring you always have the latest version without the hassle of manual installation. Perfect for users who want to avoid outdated versions from `apt` and streamline their workflow, it keeps your Hugo installation current with minimal effort. Customize it for your own system and preferred version, and enjoy a seamless update process.","params":{"apps":["hugo"],"cover":{"image":"hugo-install-update.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2025-01-03T18:36:50+08:00","description":"Automate the process of fetching the latest Hugo Extended release directly from GitHub, downloading it, and installing it, making sure your system always runs the most up-to-date version.

GreenCloud’s recent migration from SolusVM to VirtFusion is a prime example. Here's the email they sent:\n\n---\n\n*Subject: [GreenCloud] Control Panel Migration on the MILAN2SG1 node*\n\n\u003e Dear Customer,\n\u003e \n\u003e As part of our service improvement, we are migrating from our current control panel (SolusVM) to a new, modern, and user-friendly control panel called VirtFusion, which offers advanced features such as Backup/Snapshot, SSH Key management, Custom ISOs and more. \n\u003e \n\u003e Since this is a manual process, so we kindly ask you to back up your VPS on the MILAN2SG1 node and notify us once this is done so we can create a new VPS on VirtFusion for you. If needed, we can retain your old IPv4 address. Please open a ticket with our Technical Department when you're ready. Please do not reply to this email directly as it might go to our Spam/Junk folder.\n\u003e\n\u003e If you prefer to remain on SolusVM, a migration may be required to merge with our available SolusVM nodes. We will notify you with a schedule at that time. Kindly let us know your decision within 10 days of receiving this email.\n\u003e\n\u003e Best regards,  \n\u003e GreenCloud Team\n\n---\n\n**The Hassle of Migration**\n\nInstead of a smooth transition, GreenCloud’s migration process places the burden on customers:\n\n1. **Manual Backups**  \n   No tools or instructions for backing up data. Customers must do it themselves.\n\n2. **Reinstallation of Systems**  \n   A complete OS reinstall means customers need to manually restore backups and reconfigure their setups.\n\n3. **Changing IP Address and DNS Records**  \n   Most likely, a new IP address will be assigned, forcing customers to update DNS records manually and endure service downtime.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGreenCloud’s approach to migration highlights the real cost of cheap VPS hosting: when the price is low, customers are often left to deal with the burdens and frustrations that providers should be handling, disrupting services and causing unnecessary hassle.","params":{"cover":{"image":"greencloud-cp-migration.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2024-12-28T17:59:59+08:00","description":"GreenCloud's recent migration process highlights the hidden costs of cheap VPS hosting.

This forces Tailscale to handle DNS resolution, which may not always be what you want.\n\nBy default, when you enable **MagicDNS** in the Tailscale admin panel, it overwrites your `/etc/resolv.conf` file with its DNS server `100.100.100.100`. If you add a custom nameserver and enable **Override local DNS**, Tailscale will apply that DNS server across all devices in your Tailnet. This is useful if you’re using services like Pi-Hole or NextDNS.\n\nBut what if you want to disable Tailscale DNS on certain devices and revert to local DNS settings?\n\n## Disabling Tailscale DNS on Linux\n\nTo disable Tailscale's DNS management on Linux, run:\n\n```bash\nsudo tailscale set --accept-dns=false\n```\n\nThis command will revert your `/etc/resolv.conf` to the DNS values it had before Tailscale was installed, like `1.1.1.1` or `8.8.8.8`. Your Linux server will no longer be affected by Tailscale's DNS settings, which is useful if you prefer to manage DNS locally, particularly on a VPS where misconfigurations, either in the DNS settings or the ACL, can be problematic.\n\n## Tailscale DNS on Windows\n\nOn Windows, this process is easier, as there's a simple checkbox to disable Tailscale DNS in the system tray preferences. This GUI option offers a more straightforward way to adjust DNS settings without needing terminal commands.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTailscale’s DNS management is convenient, but sometimes you may need to regain control over DNS settings. Disabling Tailscale DNS on Linux is a quick way to ensure your server uses local DNS settings, keeping your configuration simple and reliable.","params":{"apps":["tailscale"],"cover":{"image":"tailscale-dns.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2024-12-11T13:02:41+08:00","description":"Tailscale automatically manages DNS settings, but you may prefer to use local DNS servers.

But starting with newer models like the JBL Go 3, manufacturers have dropped this feature—and it’s frustrating. Why might this be happening?\n\nOne reason could be cost-cutting. Adding a microphone requires extra hardware and software like noise cancellation, which might not be worth the expense for manufacturers if most users aren’t using it. It’s also possible that companies want to simplify their devices, focusing on sound quality and portability instead of trying to make them all-purpose tools.\n\nAnother possibility is that manufacturers don’t want Bluetooth speakers to overlap with other products like smart speakers or earbuds, which are better suited for calls. Removing the mic helps clearly position Bluetooth speakers as music devices and avoids complaints about call quality or compatibility issues.\n\nBut for people like me, this design shift creates a real problem. If you use a mobile device like an Android phone or tablet for online meetings, a Bluetooth speaker without a mic is practically useless. You can’t separate the audio and mic functions, meaning you’re forced to either use the phone’s built-in speaker or switch to headphones. This limitation doesn’t exist on laptops, where you can mix and match input and output devices more freely. \n\nThe result? A once-convenient feature is gone, making Bluetooth speakers less versatile. While manufacturers might have their reasons, it feels like a step backward for users who relied on this functionality.","params":{"cover":{"image":"bluetooth-speaker-mute.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2024-12-09T13:34:36+08:00","description":"Bluetooth speakers are increasingly losing built-in microphones, reducing their versatility for online meetings.

Both tools have their strengths and weaknesses, so I’ve been testing them side by side to see how they compare.\n\n### Paperless NGX: Great Features, but Too Much?\n\n[Paperless NGX](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) has a lot going for it:\n\n- **Organizes \u0026 Tags Documents**: Scan and categorize documents with custom tags, correspondents, types, and more for easy retrieval.\n- **OCR \u0026 Multi-Language Support**: Performs OCR on scanned documents, making them searchable. Supports over 100 languages via the Tesseract engine.\n- **Local Data Storage \u0026 Security**: Your data is stored securely on your own server, with no transmission or sharing of your files.\n- **PDF/A Format for Long-Term Storage**: Documents are saved in PDF/A format, designed for long-term storage, alongside the original files.\n- **Machine Learning for Metadata**: Automatically tags documents with correspondents and document types, streamlining organization.\n- **Supports Multiple File Types**: Supports PDFs, images, Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), and more.\n- **Modern Web Interface**: Features a customizable dashboard, filtering options, drag-and-drop uploads, and customizable views. It also supports custom fields and shareable public links.\n- **Powerful Search \u0026 Auto-Suggestions**: Full-text search, autocomplete, relevance-based sorting, and document highlighting make finding files efficient.\n- **Email Processing**: Import and process documents directly from email accounts with customizable rules for actions such as marking as read or deleting.\n- **Consume Folder**: Automatically processes documents dropped into a designated folder, making it easy to quickly add documents to the system without manual uploads.\n- **Multi-User Permissions \u0026 Workflow**: A robust permissions system, with global and per-document access control, and a powerful workflow system for advanced management.\n- **Optimized for Performance**: Utilizes multi-core systems for parallel document processing and includes an integrated sanity checker to ensure document archive health.\n\nHowever, these features come with some drawbacks:\n\n1. **High Memory Usage**: Paperless NGX uses about 1.4 GB of memory even when it’s idle. On a system with 11 GB of RAM, this is noticeable.\n2. **Machine Learning Accuracy**: Predictions are inconsistent. Correspondent and document type are about 50% accurate, and creation date predictions are wrong 80% of the time.\n3. **Custom Fields**: While you can create custom fields, they don’t appear by default and need to be enabled manually for every new document.\n4. **Editing Limitations**: Updating metadata for multiple documents is cumbersome since each document must be opened individually. A grid-style interface, similar to Airtable or spreadsheet apps, for faster and more efficient bulk editing would have been much better.\n\n### PDFDing: Simple, Lightweight, and Efficient\n\n[PDFDing](https://github.com/mrmn2/PdfDing) takes a minimalist approach, using tags instead of multiple metadata fields. Its design is sleek and straightforward, similar to tools like {{\u003c applink \"Linkding\" \u003e}}, which I already use and appreciate.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of PDFDing is how light it is on system resources. It uses only about 156 MB of memory on average, a fraction of what Paperless NGX demands.\n\nAdditionally, a standout feature of PDFDing is its ease of use on both desktop and mobile devices. When opening a document in the web app on a mobile browser, it’s displayed directly in the browser without triggering a download. This saves storage space and avoids cluttering your downloads folder with duplicate files if you repeatedly access the same document. In contrast, Paperless NGX downloads the file each time it’s viewed in full-page mode on mobile browsers, which can quickly become messy.\n\n### What’s Missing in PDFDing\n\nDespite its simplicity, PDFDing isn’t perfect. The biggest feature I miss is Paperless NGX’s **consume folder**, which makes it easy to add and organize documents automatically. If PDFDing could implement this, it would make the decision to switch much easier.\n\n### Resource Usage Comparison\n\nTo give some context, I’m running these tools on a system with 11 GB of RAM. Here’s how they compare in terms of system resource usage over the past week:\n\n#### Paperless NGX\n\n| Container Name      | AveCPU    | AveMem (MiB) | AveMem%    |\n|---------------------|-----------|--------------|------------|\n| paperless-webserver | 7.10%     | 1155.12      | 10.53%     |\n| paperless-tika      | 0.26%     | 277.51       | 2.53%      |\n| paperless-gotenberg | 0.06%     | 6.63         | 0.06%      |\n| paperless-redis     | 0.39%     | 4.78         | 0.04%      |\n| **Total**           | **7.81%** | **1444.05**  | **13.17%** |\n\n#### PDFDing\n\n| Container Name | AveCPU    | AveMem (MiB) | AveMem%   |\n|----------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|\n| pdfding        | 0.02%     | 156.36       | 1.43%     |\n| **Total**      | **0.02%** | **156.36**   | **1.43%** |\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nRight now, I’m undecided. Paperless NGX has powerful features but can feel over-engineered and resource-hungry. PDFDing is minimalist and efficient but lacks some key features I rely on.\n\nFor now, I’ll keep running both systems and see how PDFDing fits into my workflow. If it can streamline document management without too many compromises, it might be worth switching.\n","params":{"apps":["pdfding","paperless-ngx","linkding"],"cover":{"image":"document-management.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2024-12-03T11:16:34+08:00","description":"A personal reflection on the features and limitations of Paperless NGX and PDFDing as I consider simplifying my document management system.","draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2024-12-03T11:16:34+08:00","publishdate":"2024-12-03T11:16:34+08:00","showtoc":true,"slug":"switch-paperless-ngx-pdfding","summary":"Paperless NGX is a feature-rich tool, but its complexity and resource usage have led me to explore simpler alternatives like PDFDing.","tags":["document-management","minimalism"],"title":"Contemplating a Switch from Paperless NGX to PDFDing","tocopen":true},"permalink":"https://deuts.org/p/switch-paperless-ngx-pdfding/","title":"Contemplating a Switch from Paperless NGX to PDFDing"},{"content":"{{\u003c linkding_title \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c linkding_description \u003e}}\nA long read about the personal take of a Pinoy urban planner who worked for a Luzon real estate developer.\n{{\u003c /linkding_description \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c linkding_notes \u003e}}\nBubble or not, the real estate prices are off the roof right now.\n{{\u003c /linkding_notes \u003e}}\n\n","params":{"aside_type":"linkding","atags":["Investing","RealEstate"],"date":"2024-12-02T00:03:18+08:00","draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2024-12-02T00:03:18+08:00","ld_fav":"https://bm.deuts.org/static/https_www_reddit_com.png","ld_id":269,"ld_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1f8s6cg/response_to_honest_state_of_the_philippine_real/","publishdate":"2024-12-02T00:03:18+08:00","slug":"269-honest-state-of-the-philippine-real-estate-in-2024","title":"Honest state of the Philippine Real Estate in 2024"},"permalink":"https://deuts.org/x/269-honest-state-of-the-philippine-real-estate-in-2024/","title":"Honest state of the Philippine Real Estate in 2024"},{"content":"The Philippine condo market is under scrutiny as rising prices, shrinking rental yields, and climbing vacancy rates raise red flags.

Based on my personal experience and internal calculations, rental yields for new developments more likely fall below 3%, making renting significantly more affordable than buying. In areas like BGC, walking around at night reveals that many buildings appear under 20% occupied—perhaps even closer to 10%—judging by how few units are lit. This supports concerns about overbuilding and waning foreign demand. The absence of official vacancy rate data only adds to the market's opacity.  \n\nDespite these challenges, I see potential opportunities if a market correction occurs.

But lately, the experience has become tiresome, thanks to how vendors are allowed to list multiple specs—and even entirely different models—on a single product page.  \n\nTake the Beelink SER5 Max Mini PC as an example. This model, powered by the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor, has been on my radar for a while. Typically, the 32GB RAM and 1TB NVMe storage variant sells for around Php22,000. But when you search for it on Lazada, you’ll encounter listings priced as low as Php7,995.  \n\nSounds like a steal, right? Not so fast.  \n\nWhen you click on the listing, you’ll find that the advertised price isn’t for the SER5 Max. Instead, it applies to an entirely different product—the Beelink S12 Pro with an N100 CPU, no RAM, and no storage. To make matters worse, these listings lump together multiple models, including the Beelink S12, SER3 3750H, SER5 5560U, and SER5 Max, each in varying configurations of RAM and storage.  \n\nBy the time you navigate through the confusing options and finally select the SER5 Max with 32GB RAM and 1TB NVMe, the price is often much higher than expected—or the variant is not even available.  \n\nThis approach makes it nearly impossible to distinguish real deals from regular prices. For shoppers like me, it’s a frustrating way to ruin sale events like 11.11, 12.12, or Black Friday.  \n\n### Suggestions for Lazada:\n\n- Prohibit bundling completely different products/models under a single listing. It’s acceptable to group variants of the same model with differing RAM and storage, but combining entirely unrelated products should not be allowed.\n- Introduce a mechanism that enables shoppers to report sellers who use deceptive listings to mislead customers and gain undue attention.\n\nBy the way, this applies to Shopee as well. I'm just a loyal Lazada shopper (first-mover advantage), so my focus has been on Lazada so far.","params":{"cover":{"image":"online-shopping.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2024-11-30T15:36:15+08:00","description":"Navigating online shopping platforms like Lazada for Mini PCs has become increasingly difficult, with vendors bundling various specs and models into a single listing, often misleading buyers during sale events.

Refunds for any remaining subscription time have been issued and should appear in your bank accounts within 7 days.  \n\u003e  \n\u003e If anyone is interested in taking over this project, I am open to offers for a reasonable price. Please feel free to contact me at support@slicehosting.tech for further details.  \n\u003e  \n\u003e Thank you for your support, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused.  \n\u003e  \n\u003e **Best regards,**  \n\u003e *Shivang Shastri*  \n\nThis announcement marked the abrupt end of a VPS provider that had appeared promising—at least at first glance.\n\nBack in September, I signed up for a Slicehosting VPS plan because they offered a deal that seemed too good to pass up. The service had even been mentioned on [LowEndBox](https://lowendbox.com/blog/did-you-miss-slicehostings-offer-in-june-theyve-restocked-cheap-vps-in-frankfurt-and-mumbai-starting-with-16gb-ram-for-6-month/), lending it some credibility. However, as things turned out, Slicehosting has joined the ranks of fly-by-night VPS providers.\n\nHere’s the plan I got:\n\n## Plan Details  \n\n| **Description**       | **Value** |\n|-----------------------|-----------|\n| **Price ($/yr)**      | 12        |\n| **CPU Core**          | 2         |\n| **Memory (GB)**       | 4         |\n| **Storage (GB, HDD)** | 20        |\n\n---\n\n## My Experience\n\nWhile the plan looked appealing on paper, my time with Slicehosting was less than ideal. Here are some observations:  \n\n### Frequent Downtimes\nBefore this week’s closure announcement, I encountered **several instances of prolonged downtime**, sometimes lasting multiple days. This made the service unreliable, even for non-critical tasks.\n\n### Underwhelming Performance\nThe **HDD storage** was painfully slow. During performance tests, I compared the VPS’s storage to a directory mounted via rclone from OneDrive—and shockingly, the **rclone-mounted directory outperformed the VPS’s local storage**.\n\n### Refunds: Wishful Thinking?\nIn their message, Slicehosting mentioned issuing refunds for unused subscription time. While I remain hopeful, I can't help but be skeptical given how chaotic things have been.\n\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nSlicehosting’s closure is disappointing but not entirely surprising given the red flags many users observed over the past months. This experience underscores the importance of vetting VPS providers, especially when deals seem too good to be true.  \n\nFor those affected, the promise of refunds offers a glimmer of hope, but only time will tell if Slicehosting follows through.  \n\nIf you're considering a budget VPS provider, learn from experiences like this: read reviews, test performance, and, when possible, pay monthly to avoid being stuck in situations like this.\n\n## Update Jan. 16, 2025\nFiled a dispute on Paypal.

You can set a password, define an expiration period (TTL), and choose to have the note self-destruct after being read.  \n\n### A Promising Alternative to PrivateBin  \n\nI’ve been using {{\u003c applink \"PrivateBin\" \u003e}} for secure note sharing, but its outdated interface often left me wishing for a modernized alternative. {{\u003c applink \"Enclosed\" \u003e}}, with its elegant default dark theme and minimalist design, feels like a breath of fresh air.  \n\nWhile I haven’t completely switched yet, I’m seriously contemplating making Enclosed my primary tool. It addresses several pain points I had with PrivateBin, such as:  \n\n1. **A Modern, Elegant Interface:** Enclosed stays true to its design philosophy, providing a clean and visually appealing experience.  \n2. **Improved Reliability:** I often faced issues with PrivateBin where pastes would disappear after upgrades. I’m optimistic that Enclosed won’t suffer from the same problem, given its well-thought-out implementation.  \n\n### Features That Won Me Over  \n\nTwo recent updates in the last month to Enclosed particularly impressed me:  \n\n1. **Restricting Note Creation to Logged-In Users:** This feature adds an extra layer of control, making the platform more secure.  \n2. **No Expiration Option:** Previously, expiration periods were limited to 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month. Now, I can set notes to never expire, which is perfect for more persistent needs.  \n\nThese enhancements show the developer’s commitment to refining the app and meeting user needs, making Enclosed a very attractive alternative.  \n\n### My Wishlist for Enclosed  \n\nWhile Enclosed has been a joy to use so far, there are a few features I’d love to see added:  \n\n1. **Deleting Shared Notes:** As a logged-in user, I’d like the option to delete notes I’ve shared, provided I know the key.  \n2. **More Formatting Options:** Just like PrivateBin allows formatting pastes as markdown, plaintext, or source code, I hope Enclosed adds similar options—and ideally, supports even more formats.  \n\n### Final Thoughts  \n\nEnclosed isn’t just a potential replacement for PrivateBin—it could become the best tool for secure note sharing. While I’m still evaluating it, the updates and overall experience have made a strong case for switching for good.  \n\nIf you’re exploring alternatives for PrivateBin or looking for a secure, modern solution for note sharing, Enclosed is definitely worth a try.","params":{"apps":["enclosed","privatebin"],"cover":{"image":"secure-notes.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2024-11-27T00:13:09+08:00","description":"My thoughts on Enclosed, a minimalistic and secure web app for private note sharing, and why it’s a strong contender to replace PrivateBin in my workflow.

However, if you're managing multiple repositories or working on a single repository with specific security needs, you might want to configure SSH keys for just one repository. In this guide, we’ll walk you through setting up a dedicated SSH key to securely sync with a single GitHub repository, improving security, especially when storing private keys on remote servers or VPS.\n\n## Why Use SSH Keys for a Specific Repository?\n\nUsing a single SSH key for a repository restricts access to only that repository. This isolation is useful in several scenarios:\n- **Improved security**: If your private key is compromised, access is limited to just the target repository.\n- **Granular control**: You can control which key has access to which repository, making it easier to manage multiple keys for different tasks.\n- **Simplified automation**: When using deploy keys or automation scripts, this approach can be used to grant access to only one repository at a time.\n\n## Step 1: Generate a New SSH Key\n\nIf you don’t already have a specific SSH key for your GitHub repository, start by generating one. You can use `ssh-keygen` to create a new key pair.\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\" -f ~/.ssh/github_repo_id_ed25519\n```\n\nThis will create two files:\n- `~/.ssh/github_repo_id_ed25519` (your private key)\n- `~/.ssh/github_repo_id_ed25519.pub` (your public key)\n\nThe private key should **never** be shared or exposed, while the public key will be added to your GitHub repository.\n\n## Step 2: Add the Public Key to Your GitHub Repository\n\nGo to your GitHub repository, and in the **Settings** section, add the **public key** as a **deploy key**:\n1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Deploy Keys**.\n2. Click **Add deploy key**.\n3. Give it a name (e.g., \"GitHub SSH Key\").\n4. Paste the contents of your `github_repo_id_ed25519.pub` file into the key field.\n5. Select either **read-only** or **read-write** access depending on the level of access you want.\n\nClick **Add key** to save.\n\n## Step 3: Configure SSH for the Repository\n\nNow, configure SSH to use the specific key for accessing the repository. You can do this by adding an entry to your `~/.ssh/config` file.\n\n```bash\nnano ~/.ssh/config\n```\n\nAdd the following configuration, replacing `github-repo` with your preferred alias and ensuring the path to your private key is correct:\n\n```ssh\nHost github-repo\n    HostName github.com\n    User git\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_repo_id_ed25519\n    IdentitiesOnly yes\n```\n\nThis configuration tells SSH to use the specific key `github_repo_id_ed25519` when connecting to GitHub.\n\n## Step 4: Update or Add the Remote URL in Your Local Repository\n### Sync a local repository\nTo sync your local repository with the GitHub repository, change the remote URL to use the SSH alias you’ve configured in `~/.ssh/config`. Navigate to your local Git repository and run the following:\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/repository\ngit remote set-url origin git@github-repo:username/repository.git\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `username/repository.git` with the actual repository path.\n\n### Add remote repository to local\n\nTo add a remote repository:\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/repository\ngit init\ngit remote add origin git@github-repo:username/repository.git\n```\n\n## Step 5: Test the SSH Connection\n\nNow that everything is set up, verify that your SSH connection works properly by running:\n\n```bash\nssh -T github-repo\n```\n\nYou should see a message like:\n\n```\nHi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.\n```\n\nThis confirms that the SSH key is correctly configured and is being used to authenticate with GitHub.\n\n## Step 6: Push Changes to GitHub\n\nOnce the remote URL is updated, you can start syncing your local repository with GitHub. To push changes to your GitHub repository, simply run:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin main  # Or the relevant branch name\n```\n\nGit will use the SSH key associated with the `github-repo` alias to authenticate and push your changes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you’ve securely configured SSH to access a specific GitHub repository. This approach not only enhances security by limiting access but also provides better management of your SSH keys, especially when dealing with multiple repositories or automating workflows.\n\nWith this setup, you can now safely push, pull, and manage your GitHub repository without the risk of exposing your other repositories or credentials.","params":{"cover":{"image":"ssh-github.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2024-11-22T11:01:31+08:00","description":"A walkthrough process of configuring SSH keys to connect to a specific GitHub repository.

For many use cases, especially when I’m the sole user of the system, I find that SQLite is the perfect database choice. Here's why:\n\n- **Minimal Number of Containers** – SQLite doesn’t require a separate database server, which keeps the setup minimal. Fewer containers mean less complexity, making the Docker environment easier to maintain and monitor.\n- **I’m the Only User Most of the Time** – SQLite is embedded into the application, so there’s no need for complex client-server systems when I’m the only user. This makes it a perfect fit for small-scale, low-traffic use cases.\n- **Lightweight, Fast, and Easy to Set Up** – SQLite is lightweight and fast, with no server to configure or maintain. The database is stored in a single file, making setup quick and Docker Compose files easier to manage.\n- **Reduced Maintenance and Overhead** – Without the need for database clustering, replication, or scaling, SQLite simplifies maintenance. I only need to manage one file and ensure backups are in place.\n- **Portability and Flexibility** – SQLite databases are stored as single files, so they can be easily moved, backed up, or transferred between environments without complex configurations or network dependencies.\n- **Less Network Overhead** – Since SQLite runs locally, there’s no need for network communication, resulting in faster response times and reduced network overhead compared to client-server databases.\n\nWhenever I’m presented with multiple Docker services that serve the same purpose, or when an SQLite-only option is available, I usually prefer SQLite. Case in point: [Why I chose Medama]({{% relref \"/posts/medama-vs-google-analytics/index.md\" %}}). It's simple and fulfills my needs without the overhead of managing an additional database server, making it perfect for personal projects, prototypes, and low-traffic applications.\n\nI recognize that SQLite might not always be the best choice for every project, and I’m open to hearing differing perspectives. If you believe a dedicated database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or another RDBMS is the better route, I’d love to hear why.\n","params":{"apps":["sqlite","mysql","postgresql"],"cover":{"image":"sqlite-database.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2024-11-20T13:20:59+08:00","description":"SQLite’s embedded nature eliminates the need for complex client-server setups, reducing overhead and simplifying Docker configurations.

I wanted something that would give me the basic insights I need, without being bloated or overly complicated. After narrowing it down, I ended up considering three options: Umami, Matomo, and Medama.\n\n### Why I'm Moving Away from Google Analytics\nBefore we jump into the alternatives, let me first explain why I’m steering clear of Google Analytics—because sometimes, less is more!\n\n- **Self-Hosted Simplicity**: Google Analytics, while powerful, requires an external service and complex integration. I prefer a self-hosted solution where I have full control over my data, without relying on third-party providers.\n  \n- **Google Analytics is Hard to Navigate**: I’ve always found Google Analytics difficult to navigate, especially when looking for specific insights. The overwhelming number of features and menus can make it hard to pinpoint exactly what I want without wading through unnecessary options.\n\n- **Privacy Concerns**: While it’s not always discussed openly, Google Analytics sometimes includes tracking scripts that could be seen as invasive. With data collection practices that tie into Google's wider ecosystem, it could potentially compromise user privacy in ways that I don’t fully control. For example, data shared with Google can be used for advertising purposes, which might not align with my privacy policies.\n\n- **Excessive Complexity for Basic Needs**: For most of my websites, I don't need detailed reports or a high level of tracking. I just want to know which pages are visited, where my traffic is coming from, and what devices or browsers visitors are using. Google Analytics can do this, but it requires navigating through complex dashboards and reports that are too advanced for my simple needs.\n\n### Umami: Great but Not Without Issues\nI’ve tried **Umami** before and had some issues with it. When I upgraded to a newer version, I encountered errors that disrupted my tracking. Additionally, Umami requires a separate database container, either MySQL or Postgres, which added complexity to my setup. For a simple analytics solution, it felt like a bit too much to maintain.\n\n### Matomo: Too Bloated for My Needs\nNext up was **Matomo**, which was previously known as Piwik. I’ve used Matomo before, especially in environments like cPanel, but I found it to be too bloated for my use case. There are so many features, many of which I never use, that navigating through the platform often felt overwhelming. With countless options and pages to browse, it became difficult to figure out what was essential versus what was unnecessary. It’s powerful, but I just needed something much simpler.\n\n### What I Really Want: Simple, Effective Analytics\nAt this point, I realized that all I wanted was a simple tool that would tell me which pages on my website are popular, where my visitors are coming from, what devices and browsers they're using, and the sources that brought them there. I didn’t need extensive reports or a full-blown dashboard with complex features. I wanted basic insights without the clutter.\n\n### Why I Chose Medama\nAfter further research, I finally settled on **[Medama](https://github.com/medama-io/medama)**, and here’s why:\n\n- **Lightweight Tracker**: Medama’s simplicity is its strength. It provides just the essentials and does it well.\n- **SQLite Database Support**: Unlike Umami, Medama uses SQLite, which is easier to manage and doesn’t require setting up a separate database container.\n- **Simple and Intuitive Interface**: The interface is clean and easy to navigate, making it much more user-friendly than the other options I explored.\n\n### My Wish for Medama\nOne feature I’d love to see in Medama is the ability to filter out my own browsing activity from the statistics. It would be great to ensure my personal visits to my website don’t skew the data.\n\n### A Potential Jetpack Replacement?\nIf my experience with Medama continues to be positive, I might even consider replacing Jetpack on my WordPress site. Jetpack Stats is really the only feature that keeps me using Jetpack, alongside Akismet for spam protection. If Medama proves to be a reliable and lightweight tracker, it could serve as an ideal replacement for my needs.\n","params":{"apps":["umami","medama","matomo","wordpress"],"cover":{"image":"web-analytics.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2024-11-19T17:55:00+08:00","description":"Looking for a Google Analytics alternative, I explored several options and ultimately settled on Medama for its simplicity, lightweight nature, and ease of use.

It serves as a centralized hub for date-related calculations, enabling analysts to unlock powerful insights while maintaining a clean and organized model.\n\n## Purpose of a Calendar Table\n- **Date-based Analysis**: A calendar table allows for consistent time-based aggregations, such as year-to-date (YTD), quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), and month-over-month (MoM) comparisons.\n- **Handling Complex Calculations**: Advanced calculations like working days, fiscal calendars, or custom holidays become easier with a well-structured calendar table.\n- **Seamless Filtering**: Calendar tables provide a single source of truth for date filtering across related tables, ensuring accuracy.\n- **Improved Performance**: Predefined relationships between the calendar and fact tables improve query performance and reduce the need for repeated calculations.\n\n## Creating Calendar Table in Power Query\nIn my Excel workflow, I encountered an unusual bug while generating a Calendar table with DAX, possibly related to differences in date formats (mm/dd/yyyy vs. dd/mm/yyyy). Because of this, I prefer using Power Query to create Calendar tables. If you feel the same way, here’s the code to generate a dynamic Calendar table:\n\n```powerquery\nlet\n    StartDate = #date(2022,1,1),\n    EndDate = #date(2023,12,31),\n    Source = List.Dates(StartDate,Duration.Days(EndDate-StartDate)+1,#duration(1,0,0,0)),\n    ExpandDate = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Table.RenameColumns(Table.FromList(Source, Splitter.SplitByNothing(), null, null, ExtraValues.Error),{{\"Column1\", \"Date\"}}),{{\"Date\", type date}}),\n    InsertYear = Table.AddColumn(ExpandDate, \"Year\", each Date.Year([Date]), Int64.Type),\n    InsertMonNum = Table.AddColumn(InsertYear, \"MonNum\", each Date.Month([Date]), Int64.Type),\n    InsertMonth = Table.AddColumn(InsertMonNum, \"Month\", each Text.Start(Date.MonthName([Date]), 3), type text)\nin\n    InsertMonth\n```\n\n### How to Use This Code:\n\n1. Paste it into Power Query’s Advanced Editor.\n2. Adjust the `StartDate` and `EndDate` to fit your needs.\n3. Load the table into your model.\n\n***\n\nBy incorporating a calendar table into your data model, you gain the ability to perform more advanced and precise analysis while streamlining your workflow. Whether you use DAX or Power Query, the results will elevate the power and efficiency of your reporting.","params":{"cover":{"image":"calendar-table-cover.jpg","relative":true},"date":"2024-11-19T09:19:01+08:00","description":"Discover the importance of a calendar table in data modeling and how it simplifies date-based analysis, advanced calculations, and filtering.

After exploring my options, I decided that Cloudflare Access was the right tool for the job. \n\n### The Complexity of Authelia and Authentik  \n\nAuthelia and Authentik are robust tools for managing application security, but using them comes with several challenges:  \n\n1. **Complex Setup**: Setting up either solution requires multiple Docker containers—typically three or four—for just a single instance.  \n2. **Server Overhead**: Running these extra containers means higher resource consumption, which can strain your server and add unnecessary maintenance.  \n3. **Single Point of Failure**: These systems act as gatekeepers for your applications. If they go down, so does access to all your apps—even simple, low-risk ones. This creates a dependency that adds unnecessary risk, especially for small-scale projects.  \n4. **Time Investment**: Learning to configure and maintain these systems demands significant time and effort—something not always feasible for smaller projects.  \n\n### Why I Chose Cloudflare Access  \n\nRather than spending my time managing self-hosted tools like Authelia or Authentik, I turned to Cloudflare Access. Here’s what makes it stand out:  \n\n- **Centralized Management**: Cloudflare Access provides a unified dashboard to easily manage all your applications in one place.  \n- **Straightforward Setup**: There’s no need for additional containers or a complicated configuration process—just a few steps and you’re up and running.  \n- **Domain-Level Implementation**: Cloudflare Access is implemented directly at the domain or subdomain level, eliminating the need to spin up yet another Docker container to manage access. This makes it lightweight and efficient.\n- **Built-In Resilience**: Unlike Authelia or Authentik, Cloudflare Access avoids creating a single point of failure. Cloudflare’s globally distributed infrastructure ensures that your applications remain available, even in the face of disruptions.  \n- **Seamless Integration**: It works smoothly with popular identity providers like Google Workspace and GitHub, simplifying authentication management.  \n- **Zero Trust Security**: Cloudflare Access includes powerful features like Zero Trust policies and device posture checks, ensuring only authorized users can access your applications.  \n- **Bonus Benefits**: Using Cloudflare Access means leveraging Cloudflare’s network for additional perks like DDoS protection and improved application performance.  \n\n### Why It Might Be Right for You  \n\nIf your goal is to simplify application security without sacrificing reliability, Cloudflare Access is an excellent choice. It eliminates the complexity of self-hosted solutions, reduces server overhead, and removes the risk of losing access due to a single point of failure.  \n\n\n\n","params":{"apps":["authelia","authentik"],"cover":{"image":"cloudflare.png","relative":true},"date":"2024-11-18T09:37:51+08:00","description":"A comparison of the complexities and risks of Authelia and Authentik with the simplicity and reliability of using Cloudflare Access for application security.","draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2024-11-18T09:37:51+08:00","publishdate":"2024-11-18T09:37:51+08:00","showtoc":false,"slug":"cloudflareaccess-vs-authelia-vs-authentik","summary":"Authelia and Authentik are powerful tools for securing applications, but their complexity and inherent single points of failure make Cloudflare Access a better choice for me.","tags":["cloudflare","authentication","security"],"title":"I Choose Cloudflare Access over Authelia/Authentik","tocopen":false},"permalink":"https://deuts.org/p/cloudflareaccess-vs-authelia-vs-authentik/","title":"I Choose Cloudflare Access over Authelia/Authentik"},{"content":"{{\u003c linkding_title \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c linkding_description \u003e}}\nNo tracking.

For a while, Resilio Sync seemed like the perfect solution. But a recent issue has me questioning whether it’s as reliable as I believed.  \n\n---\n\n### The Issue: \"No Tracker Connection Available\"\n\nJust today, I encountered an unsettling error in Resilio Sync: **\"No tracker connection available.\"** After a quick search, I found a [discussion in the Resilio Sync community](https://forum.resilio.com/topic/75482-no-tracker-connection-available-and-download-configuration-file-test/) confirming that others are facing the same issue.  \n\nThis raised several concerns:  \n- Does Resilio Sync rely on a single centralized tracker server?  \n- If so, is this a critical single point of failure?  \n- Can I continue trusting this service for my essential files?  \n\nThe more I thought about it, the more uneasy I became about relying solely on Resilio Sync.  \n\n---\n\n### Why This Is a Problem  \n\nReliability is critical for any file synchronization tool. My files—and particularly my Obsidian vaults—must remain accessible, no matter what. A centralized server outage undermines this reliability, potentially leaving me unable to sync files when I need them most.  \n\n---\n\n### Why I Chose Resilio Sync Over Syncthing  \n\nI switched to Resilio Sync after experiencing some frustrations with Syncthing. Here’s why:  \n1. **Mobile App Support:**  \n   - Resilio Sync has a reliable Android app and an official iOS app (even though I’m not using iOS right now).  \n   - Syncthing’s Android app has been [discontinued](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/discontinuing-syncthing-android/23002), and there’s no official iOS app, which made Resilio Sync the better choice for cross-platform use.  \n\n2. **User-Friendly Interface:**  \n   - Resilio Sync offers a polished GUI, whereas I found Syncthing’s login system problematic in the past.  \n\n3. **Selective Sync:**  \n   - This feature is a game-changer for saving storage space on mobile devices and is unavailable in Syncthing.  \n\nThese factors made Resilio Sync seem like the ideal solution. But today’s issue makes me wonder if I prioritized convenience over long-term reliability.  \n\n---\n\n### The Bigger Picture: Can I Trust Resilio Sync?  \n\nThis experience highlights an important question: should I rethink my choice of file synchronization tool? While Resilio Sync offers valuable features, its potential reliance on a central tracker server feels like a vulnerability.  \n\nI’m now left pondering:  \n- Should I revisit Syncthing, even with its app limitations and lack of selective sync?  \n- Are there other alternatives that balance reliability and functionality better?  \n\nFor now, I’ll be closely watching how quickly Resilio Sync resolves this issue. But one thing is certain: my trust in the platform has taken a hit.  \n\n### Update: Trackers Up Now\n\nAfter nearly 1.5 days, the trackers are finally back online.

Using Caddy’s built-in HTTPS functionality is easy, but situations involving firewalls, CGNAT, or a lack of access to port 80/443 benefit from Cloudflare's DNS challenge for seamless certificate automation. This tutorial outlines how to build a custom Caddy Docker image that integrates Cloudflare’s DNS module using `xcaddy` to streamline this process.\n\n### Why Opt for Cloudflare DNS Challenge?\n\nCaddy's HTTP and TLS challenges work well for most, but the DNS challenge shines when:\n- Your server is behind a firewall or CGNAT.\n- Your service is behind Cloudflare access policy\n- You want to avoid exposing ports 80 and 443 to the public.\n- Your setup includes a load balancer or other restrictive networking configurations.\n\nThis method authenticates your domain ownership via the Cloudflare DNS API, allowing Caddy to fetch certificates without the need for open HTTP/HTTPS ports. See [How the DNS Challenge Works](#how-the-dns-challenge-works) for more info.\n\n### Building a Custom Caddy Image\n\nThe Dockerfile follows a multi-stage build:\n1. **Builder Stage**: We use `xcaddy` to compile Caddy with the Cloudflare DNS provider plugin.\n2. **Final Stage**: The resulting binary is copied to a fresh Caddy image, creating a production-ready and lean container.\n\n### How to Set Up and Run\n\n#### Step 1: Create a Custom Docker Network (Optional)\n\nCreating a custom Docker network keeps services isolated and minimizes the need to expose ports on your VPS:\n```bash\ndocker network create caddynetwork\n```\n\nIf you choose a different network name, ensure the `compose.yml` file reflects it.\n\n#### Step 2: Create your `compose.yml` file\n\nBelow is the `compose.yml` configuration, which builds a custom Caddy Docker image and sets up networking for enhanced security:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  caddy:\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile\n    container_name: caddy\n    environment:\n      - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=\u003cENTER YOUR TOKEN HERE\u003e\n      - CADDY_ACME_EMAIL=\u003cENTER YOUR EMAIL HERE\u003e\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n      - \"443:443\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile\n      - ./data:/data\n      - ./config:/config\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    networks:\n      - caddynetwork\n\nnetworks:\n  caddynetwork:\n    external: true\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Configure `compose.yml`\n\nRename `_compose.yml` to `compose.yml` and set your environment variables:\n```yaml\nenvironment:\n  - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=\u003cYOUR_TOKEN\u003e\n  - CADDY_ACME_EMAIL=\u003cYOUR_EMAIL\u003e\n```\n- **CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN**: Ensure this token has permissions for DNS zone edits on Cloudflare.\n- **CADDY_ACME_EMAIL**: This email will be used by ACME for certificate registration.\n\n#### Step 4: Build and Run\n\nUse Docker Compose to build and start the container in detached mode:\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d --build\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Edit Your Caddyfile\n\nAdjust your `Caddyfile` with the necessary domain and service details. Here’s a sample:\n```caddy\nexample.com {\n  reverse_proxy localhost:8080\n  tls {\n    dns cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}\n  }\n}\n```\n- Replace `example.com` with your actual domain.\n- Set `localhost` to the name or IP of your backend service.\n- Adjust `8080` to the port where your application runs.\n\nWith this setup, Caddy will use Cloudflare’s DNS challenge to obtain certificates, keeping your services secure without exposing common HTTP/HTTPS ports.\n\n***\n\n### How the DNS Challenge Works\n\nTypically, to issue an SSL/TLS certificate, Caddy (or any Certificate Authority, CA) needs to verify that you actually own the domain in question. Normally, this is done by:\n1. **HTTP Challenge**: Verifying domain ownership by placing a file on an accessible web server running on port 80.\n2. **TLS-ALPN Challenge**: Verifying via a specific response from a server running on port 443.\n\nHowever, both these methods require public access to specific ports on the server (80 or 443), which may not be feasible if:\n- **Your server is behind a firewall** or behind Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT) on a network that doesn’t expose external ports.\n- **You don’t want to expose ports 80 and 443 publicly** for security or regulatory reasons.\n- **You’re using a load balancer** or reverse proxy setup where ports may not map directly to a specific server.\n\n### Why the Cloudflare DNS Challenge Solves This\n\nThe **DNS challenge** verifies domain ownership by checking for specific DNS records instead of requiring public access to your server. Here’s how it works:\n1. **Caddy uses Cloudflare’s API to add a special TXT record to your domain’s DNS settings** (hosted on Cloudflare).\n2. **The CA (e.g., Let’s Encrypt) queries Cloudflare’s DNS servers** for the TXT record to verify domain ownership.\n3. Once verified, the CA issues a certificate to Caddy for your domain, which it saves and manages.\n\nBecause the DNS challenge doesn’t involve your server’s IP address or port accessibility, it allows Caddy to obtain certificates even when direct access to your server is restricted.\n\n### Why You Need Cloudflare API Permissions\n\nThe DNS challenge requires dynamically creating and removing DNS records on your domain during each certificate renewal. By providing Caddy with Cloudflare’s API token, you enable it to manage the necessary DNS records for verification, fully automating the certificate issuance and renewal process without exposing any ports.\n\nIn summary, **the Cloudflare DNS challenge is essential** when public port access is unavailable or undesirable. It’s a robust way to automate certificate management, especially in complex network environments, by verifying domain ownership through DNS rather than HTTP or TLS ports.","params":{"apps":["caddy"],"date":"2024-11-15T08:11:44+08:00","description":"Configure a custom Caddy Docker image to use Cloudflare’s DNS challenge, securing HTTPS without exposing ports 80/443, ideal for firewall, CGNAT, and load-balancer setups.","draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2024-11-15T08:11:44+08:00","publishdate":"2024-11-15T08:11:44+08:00","showtoc":true,"slug":"caddy-docker-cloudflare-dns-challenge","summary":"This guide provides a custom Dockerized Caddy image setup that uses Cloudflare DNS for SSL/TLS verification, ideal for servers behind firewalls or NAT.","tags":["docker","cloudflare"],"title":"Custom Caddy Docker image with Cloudflare DNS challenge support","tocopen":true},"permalink":"https://deuts.org/p/caddy-docker-cloudflare-dns-challenge/","title":"Custom Caddy Docker image with Cloudflare DNS challenge support"},{"content":"\nHTTP Basic Authentication offers a quick way to secure access to internal or staging services in a Docker environment, especially for controlled scenarios where high security isn’t critical. Although credentials sent via Basic Authentication can be decoded if intercepted, combining it with HTTPS ensures encryption, making it suitable for simple use cases. Here, we’ll set up Caddy as a reverse proxy with Basic Authentication to limit access to a service running in another container.\n\n### Scenario Overview\n\nIn this example, we have:\n- A **Caddy container** named `caddy`\n- A **service container** named `sampledockercontainer`, which is the service we’re protecting, running on port `8080`\n- Both containers are on the same **Docker network**\n- The goal is to limit access to the `sampledockercontainer` service with Basic Authentication\n\n### Setting Up the Caddyfile\n\nStart with a simple Caddyfile that proxies traffic to the `sampledockercontainer`:\n\n```Caddyfile\nexample.com {\n    reverse_proxy sampledockercontainer:8080\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration forwards all requests for `example.com` to the `sampledockercontainer` service within the Docker network.\n\n### Generating a Hashed Password for Authentication\n\nSince Caddy is running as a Docker container, use the following `docker exec` command to generate a hashed password for authentication:\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it caddy caddy hash-password --plaintext 'yoursupersecretpassword'\n```\n\nAssuming your username is `user`, the command returns a hashed password like:\n\n```\n$2a$14$UnmpufOS3hIBsW5Jn.lbpe0qtoa5kCKYfJNPGsgnOr2D6mPma8aPm\n```\n\n### Adding Basic Authentication to the Caddyfile\n\nUpdate the Caddyfile to include Basic Authentication, securing access to `example.com`:\n\n```Caddyfile\nexample.com {\n    basicauth {\n        user $2a$14$UnmpufOS3hIBsW5Jn.lbpe0qtoa5kCKYfJNPGsgnOr2D6mPma8aPm\n    }\n    reverse_proxy sampledockercontainer:8080\n}\n```\n\nNow, visitors will be prompted for a username and password before gaining access.\n\n### Restricting Authentication to Specific Paths\n\nYou may want only certain paths to require authentication, allowing general access to others. For example, you can limit Basic Authentication to the `/admin` path while keeping the root URL publicly accessible:\n\n```Caddyfile\nexample.com {\n    basicauth /admin/* {\n        user $2a$14$UnmpufOS3hIBsW5Jn.lbpe0qtoa5kCKYfJNPGsgnOr2D6mPma8aPm\n    }\n    reverse_proxy /admin/* sampledockercontainer:8080\n    reverse_proxy /* sampledockercontainer:8080\n}\n```\n\nWith this setup:\n- Requests to `example.com` are open to all users.\n- Requests to `example.com/admin/` require a valid username and password.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis Caddyfile setup demonstrates a simple, effective way to protect containerized services with Basic Authentication. For Dockerized applications, Caddy makes it easy to limit access to sensitive areas, securing your internal or staging environments with minimal configuration.","params":{"apps":["caddy"],"author":"deuts","date":"2024-11-14T21:46:40+08:00","description":"Learn to secure Docker services with Caddy’s Basic Authentication by setting up a reverse proxy to protect internal or staging containers and restrict access to specific paths.","draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2024-11-14T21:46:40+08:00","publishdate":"2024-11-14T21:46:40+08:00","showtoc":true,"slug":"docker-caddy-basic-auth","summary":"Learn how to secure a Docker-hosted service with Caddy’s HTTP Basic Authentication, an effective way to protect access in controlled environments.

By spotlighting key points such as tips, warnings, or action items, callouts break up dense text, making it visually engaging and easy to navigate—perfect for readers who like to skim for the good stuff. Think of them as visual pitstops for key information.\n\nBeyond making content look better, callouts help readers retain critical details. By emphasizing important points, callouts make it more likely that the message will stick long after the reader has moved on. Plus, they boost engagement, encouraging readers to linger on essential details they might otherwise miss. In short, callouts don’t just share information; they make it memorable.\n\n## Hugo support for callouts\n\nHugo doesn’t come with built-in support for callouts, but there’s a simple solution—shortcodes! By using a shortcode, you can add custom callouts to your Hugo content with ease.\n\n## Hugo shortcode for callouts\n\nThanks to Cosimameyer’s [tutorial](https://cosimameyer.com/post/customized-callout-boxes-in-hugo/) on implementing callouts in Hugo, we can use the following example shortcodes:\n\n### Info\n{{\u003c insertcode \"callouts/info.txt\" \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c callout type=\"info\" title=\"Information\" \u003e}}\nThis is an informational callout with default styling.\n{{\u003c /callout \u003e}}\n\n***\n\n### Success\n{{\u003c insertcode \"callouts/success.txt\" \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c callout type=\"success\" title=\"Success\" \u003e}}\nTell me more about your success story.\n{{\u003c /callout \u003e}}\n\n\n***\n\n### Error\n\n{{\u003c insertcode \"callouts/error.txt\" \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c callout type=\"error\" title=\"Mistake\" \u003e}}\nYou're making a big mistake!\n{{\u003c /callout \u003e}}\n\n***\n\n### Warning\n\n{{\u003c insertcode \"callouts/warning.txt\" \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c callout type=\"warning\" title=\"Caution\" \u003e}}\nYou have been warned!\n{{\u003c /callout \u003e}}\n\n***\n\n### Others\n\n{{\u003c insertcode \"callouts/others.txt\" \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c callout type=\"nothing\" title=\"Nothing\" \u003e}}\nThis is nothing!\n{{\u003c /callout \u003e}}\n","params":{"apps":["hugo"],"date":"2024-11-14T18:26:00+08:00","description":"Discover how callouts can enhance readability and engagement by highlighting key information in notes or web content.

While WordPress has long been a popular CMS, I’m increasingly drawn to the simplicity and control of static site generators like Hugo.\n\n### Why Consider Hugo Over WordPress?\nHugo’s performance and security benefits are difficult to ignore:\n\n- **Performance**: Hugo serves static HTML files without any backend load, delivering high-speed access.\n- **Security**: Without a database or PHP reliance, Hugo sites inherently avoid many vulnerabilities that affect WordPress.\n- **Customization**: Total control over templates and layouts eliminates the plugin bloat that can slow down WordPress.\n- **Version Control**: Working with Git keeps my changes organized and easy to revert if needed.\n- **Low Maintenance**: No frequent updates or patches—Hugo just works as-is, saving time on upkeep.\n\nDespite these advantages, I hesitated because managing content directly in Hugo, especially from the terminal, felt clunky compared to the WordPress dashboard. Using VS Code helped, but it was still missing that CMS simplicity.\n\n### My New Workflow: Obsidian and Hugo with Minimal Dependencies\nI've now found a balance that works without tying me to specific plugins that may become obsolete or unsupported. Here’s what my current workflow looks like:\n\n1. **Obsidian with Templater and Dataview Plugins**:\n   - I use Obsidian for creating and editing posts, keeping my Hugo directory aligned with my Obsidian vault. With Templater, I can build posts from templates and generate shortcodes. The Dataview plugin helps me get an overview of post summaries without impacting the publishing process.\n   - Notably, I’ve chosen **not** to use plugins like [Hugo Publish or Static Site MD Exporter](/hugo-and-obsidian-workflow/). Relying on such plugins could cause future complications if they’re discontinued, so I’ve kept my setup as independent as possible.\n\n2. **Building with Hugo**:\n   - After editing posts, I use Hugo to generate HTML files, configured to output to a `docs` folder for simplicity.\n\n3. **Publishing to GitHub Pages**:\n   - Pushing my Hugo directory, including the `docs` folder, to GitHub triggers publishing through GitHub Pages. This approach enables a completely self-managed site without relying on an external CMS.\n   - If I don’t have Obsidian access, I can still edit content through GitHub’s web interface, pull the changes, run Hugo to build, and push the updated site back.\n\n4. **Direct Edit Links**:\n   - For convenience, each site page includes a subtle edit button linking to the GitHub page source, making updates simple.\n\n### Considering Migration\nWhile I’m currently set on Hugo for future posts, the complexity involved in migrating [my WordPress content](https://deuts.net/) \u0026mdash; nearly 900 posts and 2,500 comments \u0026mdash; makes me pause. Migrating everything isn’t an easy task, so for now, I’m planning to blog on Hugo going forward while exploring efficient ways to gradually bring over my legacy content.\n\nThis workflow with Hugo, Obsidian and Github Pages has struck the right balance, letting me blog on my terms without depending on plugins or external services. Obsidian, Hugo, and GitHub all rely on Markdown, creating a seamless experience where these tools work in perfect harmony. For anyone seeking a lean, self-reliant approach to publishing, this setup might be the perfect fit.","params":{"apps":["obsidian","wordpress","hugo"],"date":"2024-11-13T23:44:23+08:00","description":"Exploring Hugo, Obsidian and Github Pages as a flexible and efficient blogging setup, focusing on low dependency and high control, with a look at potential WordPress migration challenges.","draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2024-11-13T23:44:23+08:00","publishdate":"2024-11-13T23:44:23+08:00","showtoc":true,"slug":"build-hugo-obsidian-github-pages-workflow","summary":"Recent WordPress controversies have pushed me toward Hugo for blogging, drawn by its performance, security, and simplicity.

This post will walk you through how to set up your local repository, link it to a GitHub repository, and push your changes, including the setup for authentication using GitHub’s Personal Access Token (PAT).\n\n### 1. Initialize a Git Repository with `main` as the Default Branch\n\nBegin by navigating to the directory where your project is located. Run the following commands to initialize Git with the `main` branch directly.\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/project\ngit init --initial-branch=main\n```\n\n### 2. Stage and Commit Your Files\n\nNext, add all files to the staging area and commit them:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n```\n\n### 3. Link Your Local Repository to GitHub\n\nNow, set up a connection to your GitHub repository. Instead of using the default `origin` label for the remote, you can specify a custom label like `github`, which will allow flexibility with multiple remotes if needed.\n\n```bash\ngit remote add github https://github.com/deuts/deuts.github.io.git\n```\n\n### 4. Push to GitHub without Using `origin`\n\nFor the first push, use the `-u` flag to set `github` as the default remote:\n\n```bash\ngit pull github main --rebase\ngit push -u github main\n```\n\nAfter this initial push, you can use `git push` and `git pull` directly without specifying the remote every time, as Git will use `github` by default for this branch.\n\n### 5. Authentication: When You'll Need Your Email and Personal Access Token (PAT)\n\nWhen pushing to GitHub for the first time, Git will prompt you to set up authentication. Here’s what to expect:\n\n- **Email**: If this is the first time using Git on your machine, Git will ask you to set your email and name:\n  ```bash\n  git config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\n  git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n  ```\n  This is required for all commits, as GitHub associates your email with your GitHub account.\n\n- **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Instead of your GitHub password, Git now requires a PAT for authentication. When prompted to log in, enter your username and the PAT as the password.\n\n  To create a PAT:\n  1. Go to [GitHub’s PAT settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).\n  2. Generate a token with `repo` access.\n  3. Use this token in place of your password when Git requests authentication.\n\n### Common Commands Summary\n\n- **Initialize a Git repository with `main`**:\n  ```bash\n  git init --initial-branch=main\n  ```\n- **Add and commit changes**:\n  ```bash\n  git add .\n  git commit -m \"Commit message\"\n  ```\n- **Add a custom remote (`github`) and push**:\n  ```bash\n  git remote add github https://github.com/deuts/deuts.github.io.git\n  git push -u github main\n  ```\n- **Push and pull with defaults**:\n  ```bash\n  git push    # no need for origin\n  git pull    # no need for origin\n  ```\n\nWith this setup, you'll be using the `main` branch, avoiding the default `origin` label, and ensuring secure access with GitHub’s Personal Access Token (PAT) system.\n\n### Watch this video if you want for more context\n{{\u003c youtube -RZ03WHqkaY \u003e}}\n","params":{"date":"2024-11-13T11:44:23+08:00","description":"Set up a Git repository with main as the initial branch, link it to GitHub with a custom remote (not origin), and authenticate using GitHub’s Personal Access Token (PAT).

In this post, I’ll highlight some common issues with the plugins I’ve encountered.\n\n## The Problem with Available Obsidian Plugins\n\n### [Hugo Publish](https://github.com/kirito41dd/obsidian-hugo-publish)\n\nOne plugin that attempts to bridge the gap between Obsidian and Hugo is **Hugo Publish**. This plugin lets you assign tags to notes, which it then processes into Markdown files that can be used with Hugo. However, there's a significant flaw: if you assign a `blog` tag to your notes for processing, the plugin carries this tag over to the output `.md` files. This means that every post, when built with Hugo, will include the `blog` tag, which is not only redundant but goes against the purpose of using tags as categories or topics.\n\nThe problem here is that **Hugo Publish** does not account for the need to handle tags dynamically for each post. In Hugo, tags are often used for grouping and categorization, and repeating the same tag across all posts diminishes their value.\n\n### [Static Site MD Exporter](https://github.com/yy4382/obsidian-static-site-export)\n\nAnother plugin, **Static Site MD Exporter**, offers a different approach by publishing the processed `.md` files directly to GitHub. From there, you can use `git pull` to bring them into your Hugo project and build the site.\n\nThis plugin offers a useful feature: by adding `published: true` in the frontmatter of a note, it marks the note for processing and publishing. However, this is where things start to break down when using Hugo. The `published` property is actually an alias for `publishDate` in Hugo, which expects a date value, not a boolean. As a result, when you run the `hugo` build command, Hugo throws an error because it cannot interpret `published: true` correctly.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nBoth the **Hugo Publish** and **Static Site MD Exporter** plugins offer valuable functionality, but they fall short in handling tags and frontmatter properties according to Hugo’s conventions. The inability of these plugins to properly manage `publishDate` and `tags` leads to errors when building the Hugo site and creates unnecessary redundancy in post tags. These are important issues that need to be addressed in order for the workflow to function smoothly with Hugo.\n","params":{"apps":["obsidian","hugo"],"date":"2024-11-12T21:44:50+08:00","description":"Highlights of issues with Obsidian plugins like Hugo Publish and Static Site MD Exporter when used in a Hugo blogging workflow.","draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2024-11-12T21:44:50+08:00","publishdate":"2024-11-12T21:44:50+08:00","slug":"hugo-and-obsidian-workflow","summary":"A guide on how to use Obsidian in conjunction with Hugo for a streamlined blogging workflow, highlighting the issues with existing Obsidian plugins and their impact on Hugo builds.","tags":["linux"],"title":"Hugo and Obsidian workflow"},"permalink":"https://deuts.org/p/hugo-and-obsidian-workflow/","title":"Hugo and Obsidian workflow"},{"content":"{{\u003c linkding_title \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c linkding_notes \u003e}}\nYou still need a registered domain name.\n{{\u003c /linkding_notes \u003e}}\n\n","params":{"aside_type":"linkding","atags":null,"date":"2024-11-10T18:15:06+08:00","draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2024-11-10T18:15:06+08:00","ld_fav":"https://bm.deuts.org/static/https_youtu_be.png","ld_id":252,"ld_url":"https://youtu.be/qlcVx-k-02E?si=ScGfFPGxhK-nd6Bb","publishdate":"2024-11-10T18:15:06+08:00","slug":"252-quick-and-easy-local-ssl-certificates-for-your-homelab","title":"Quick and Easy Local SSL Certificates for Your Homelab!"},"permalink":"https://deuts.org/x/252-quick-and-easy-local-ssl-certificates-for-your-homelab/","title":"Quick and Easy Local SSL Certificates for Your Homelab!"},{"content":"{{\u003c linkding_title \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c linkding_description \u003e}}\nA simple home inventory management software\n{{\u003c /linkding_description \u003e}}\n\n","params":{"aside_type":"linkding","atags":["Homebox","Inventory","Selfhosting"],"date":"2024-11-08T15:21:39+08:00","draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2024-11-08T15:21:39+08:00","ld_fav":"https://bm.deuts.org/static/https_homebox_software.png","ld_id":251,"ld_url":"https://homebox.software/en/installation.html","publishdate":"2024-11-08T15:21:39+08:00","slug":"251-homebox-installation","title":"HomeBox Installation"},"permalink":"https://deuts.org/x/251-homebox-installation/","title":"HomeBox Installation"},{"content":"{{\u003c linkding_title \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c linkding_description \u003e}}\nFind the best cheap server hosting and the best cheap vps hosting, where you only pay a few dollars a month, exclusively on LowEndBox\n{{\u003c /linkding_description \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c linkding_notes \u003e}}\n## 2 GB KVM VPS  \n  \n1x vCPU Core  \n25 GB SSD Storage  \n2 GB RAM  \n3000GB Monthly Bandwidth  \n1Gbps Public Network Port  \nFull Root Admin Access  \n1 Dedicated IPv4 Address  \nKVM / SolusVM  \nAvailable in Multiple Locations  \n$17.98/YEAR!\n{{\u003c /linkding_notes \u003e}}\n\n","params":{"aside_type":"linkding","atags":["Selfhosting","VPSOffers"],"date":"2024-11-08T08:04:39+08:00","draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2024-11-08T08:04:39+08:00","ld_fav":"https://bm.deuts.org/static/https_lowendbox_com.png","ld_id":250,"ld_url":"https://lowendbox.com/blog/racknerds-11-11-sale-now-live-kvm-vps-from-11-11-year-in-los-angeles-san-jose-seattle-dallas-chicago-new-york-and-atlanta/","publishdate":"2024-11-08T08:04:39+08:00","slug":"250-racknerd-s-11-11-sale-now-live-kvm-vps-from-11-11-year","title":"RackNerd's 11.11 Sale NOW LIVE!

And I'm still wondering how to install Mastodon on Debian 11 without Docker. And here's the AI's response:\n\n## How to Install Mastodon on Debian 11 Without Docker (instructions generated from ChatGPT)\n\nTo install Mastodon, the open-source, decentralized social networking platform, on Debian 11 without using Docker, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed on your system. This includes PostgreSQL, Redis, and Yarn. You can install these using the following commands:\n```\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib\nsudo apt-get install redis-server\ncurl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -\necho \"deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list\nsudo apt-get update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt-get install yarn\n```\n\n2. Next, clone the Mastodon Git repository to your local machine using the following command:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon.git\n```\n\n3. Navigate to the Mastodon directory and install the necessary dependencies using Yarn:\n```\ncd mastodon\nyarn install\n```\n\n4. Next, you will need to configure Mastodon by copying the .env.production.sample file to .env.production and editing it to set the appropriate values for your environment. This includes setting up your database, caching, and other options.\n\n5. Once the configuration is complete, you can compile the Mastodon assets using the following command:\n```\nRAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\n6. Finally, you can start the Mastodon server using the following command:\n```\nRAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails s\n```\n\nMastodon should now be running on your system. You can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\nNote: The steps outlined above are a simplified version of the installation instructions for Mastodon. For more detailed instructions and additional options, please refer to the Mastodon documentation.\n\n## I still have to try this\nAnd I still have to try this soon.

The rest are just aesthetics.\n\n## iMessage\nI don't have an iPhone right now, but who texts nowadays anyway? If you look closely at my messages app, they're mostly made up of OTPs and marketing messages. Not much from real contacts.\n\nWhere I'm from and where I work, messaging is usually done via Viber and Facebook Messenger. So I'll just say damn to those who insist on iMessage.\n\nMoreover, I think the Android messages app has a more robust anti-spam capability than the iPhone. By the way, did you know that you can't change the default SMS app in the iPhone?\n\n## Airdrop\nWho needs original quality photos? They're big in file size and you're not printing them into billboards anyway. And if you really need it, there are alternatives other than Google Drive.\n\n## Indispensable on my Android\n### Dual Sim\nYes, there are dual-sim and e-Sim capable iPhones but you have to be very special to use one especially in the Philippines. Globe and Smart can only activate your e-Sim if you're on a postpaid plan. You'll need to procure yours from HongKong if you want a dual-sim iPhone. Almost every Android phone has dual-sim capability.\n\n### Torrenting apps\nI don't use my uTorrent app too often on my Android phone as I have a Qbittorrent hosted on a VPS, but I'm glad that it's there when I need it.\n\n### Syncthing\nNot on an iPhone. Period.\n\n### USB Type-C\nThis may change soon, but I'm leaving it here anyway. I can carry around with me just one charger for my laptop, tablet and smartphone.\n\n### Customizable Home Screen\nThis feature may become a time-waster sometimes, even a resource-hog, but the fact that I can move around app icons even to the bottom of the screen offers a lot of flexibility on how I want my phone to look each time I unlock it.\n\nIf you're not too convinced, check out [r/NovaLauncher](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovaLauncher/) and [r/NiagaraLauncher](https://www.reddit.com/r/NiagaraLauncher/) for inspiration.\n\n### Expandable Storage\nThis feature probably becomes less attractive as built-in storage options become larger, but I'm still attracted to this option, and plays a role in my decision to stick to Android, at least for the foreseeable future.\n\n### Dual Accounts/Profile\nI know apps like Facebook and Messenger have the capability to run multiple profiles in the same app, but I don't think you can get notifications for them all.\n\nWith features like in the Samsung's secret folder, you can essentially have two separate Viber accounts for example running, and you'll get notifications from both accounts.\n","params":{"date":"2022-11-04T12:11:31+08:00","description":"This discusses why I prefer Android over Apple, highlighting key features that are indispensable to me, such as dual SIM, torrenting apps, Syncthing, USB Type-C, customizable home screens, expandable storage, and dual accounts/profile.

Fortunately I was able to make it work in my system, even without exposing additional ports to the public, which I'm sharing below.\n\n## Why Joplin Server instead of Webdav, Dropbox, OneDrive, NextCloud, etc.\nAccording to [Noted](https://noted.lol/install-joplin-server-using-docker-compose/):\n- Speed up the sync  \n*I still have to find out if this really is true*\n- Sharing a note with anyone, using a URL  \n*This is actually my favorite feature. This enables me to share notes that are not so private to other people by just sharing a link to the public page. Then as I update my note, the page also updates.*\n- User access  \n*I still have to evangelize other people about Joplin so I could add users to my Joplin server, if ever they need a sync server.* \n- Sharing a notebook with a user on the same Joplin Server  \n*This is also a great feature, especially if I have other users I can share my Joplin server with.*\n\n## Docker Compose for Joplin Server\n### Docker Network\nMake sure that you already have a ready Docker Network for your Joplin app and database. This will make sure that you don't expose additional ports to the public. If you don't have a dedicated network yet, just run:\n```bash\nsudo docker network create -d bridge examplenetwork\n```\n\n### Nginx Proxy Manager\nI would assume that you already have the Nginx Proxy Manager installed and it's running in the same `examplenetwork` . Now, add a new Proxy Host with your domain name, e.g. `joplin.example.com`, then hostname should be `joplin_app` (container name below) and port `22300`.\n\n### Install Joplin App and DB\n\nOn your favorite directory, just create the `docker-compose.yml` file, which should contain:\n\n```yml\nversion: '3'\n\nservices:\n    db:\n        image: postgres:13\n        container_name: joplin_db\n        volumes:\n            - ./data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n#        ports:\t\twe don't need this anymore because we're reverse proxying anyway\n#            - \"5432:5432\"\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        environment:\n            - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yHZ4TbsyKJI0Xi2sUmXDuz\n            - POSTGRES_USER=Barrier1542\n            - POSTGRES_DB=Sudden9997\n        networks:\n            - examplenetwork\n    app:\n        image: joplin/server:latest\n        depends_on:\n            - db\n        container_name: joplin_app\n#        ports:\t\twe don't need this anymore because we're reverse proxying anyway\n#            - \"22300:22300\"\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        environment:\n            - APP_PORT=22300\n            - APP_BASE_URL=https://joplin.example.com\n            - DB_CLIENT=pg\n            - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yHZ4TbsyKJI0Xi2sUmXDuz\n            - POSTGRES_DATABASE=Sudden9997\n            - POSTGRES_USER=Barrier1542\n            - POSTGRES_PORT=5432\n            - POSTGRES_HOST=db\n        networks:\n            - examplenetwork \n\nnetworks:\n        examplenetwork:\n            external: true\n```\n\nDon't worry about the usernames and passwords in my sample `docker-compose.yml` file, they were just randomly generated and not used for production elsewhere.\n\nThen run `sudo docker-compose up -d`\n\nDid you know that the Joplin docker image alone is worth 1.2GB of storage in your server? Postgres is another 373MB.\n\n## Backup with Duplicati\nAs Joplin populates your `/data/postgres` folder in the initial setup, as well as along the way as you actually use your server, it creates files and directories with user and group permissions assigned to `systemd-coredump`. Worse, they are readable and writable by the user only. That is usually fine, until you try backing them up using Duplicati.\n\nThe solution: run your Duplicati docker app with root privileges. \n\nI know the rule about not running apps as root. But that's the only way I see so far that work. Perhaps, Joplin could give us an option to create and update files in the persistent volumes as a regular user. That way, I can run Duplicati as that same user and could access the files for backup.\n\n## Update as of Mar. 24, 2024\nFor whatever reason, recently I noticed my Joplin server was down. The GUI is not accessible, and the sync process is not pushing though. Looked at the log, and it appears the Joplin app container is having trouble connecting to the Postgres database. \n\nIn order to fix it, I needed to remove all the reference to the examplenetwork and uncomment all ports to make them active. Moreover, I needed to point directly the hostname in Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) to the server's IP address.\n```yml\nversion: '3'\n\nservices:\n    db:\n        image: postgres:13\n        container_name: joplin_db\n        volumes:\n            - ./data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n        ports:\n            - \"5432:5432\"\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        environment:\n            - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yHZ4TbsyKJI0Xi2sUmXDuz\n            - POSTGRES_USER=Barrier1542\n            - POSTGRES_DB=Sudden9997\n    app:\n        image: joplin/server:latest\n        depends_on:\n            - db\n        container_name: joplin_app\n        ports:\n            - \"22300:22300\"\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        environment:\n            - APP_PORT=22300\n            - APP_BASE_URL=https://joplin.example.com\n            - DB_CLIENT=pg\n            - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yHZ4TbsyKJI0Xi2sUmXDuz\n            - POSTGRES_DATABASE=Sudden9997\n            - POSTGRES_USER=Barrier1542\n            - POSTGRES_PORT=5432\n            - POSTGRES_HOST=db\n```\n","params":{"apps":["joplin","npm","duplicati"],"date":"2022-10-24T22:03:23+08:00","description":"A guide on setting up a Joplin server using Docker Compose, including benefits like faster syncing, easy note sharing, and user access.

But you can only do that on a computer. These media are better consumed over TV, right?\n\nThen, the rise of Netflix showed us a glipmse of how your media should be better managed \u0026mdash; with posters or thumbnails, description or summary, genre, casts list, and even related movies to watch after. I remember I used to have several hard drives with duplicate movies from several sources or several different versions and video codecs. Worse, it was so hard to keep track back then which movies you've already watched or what episode of a show did you last watch.\n\nThen came Kodi. And you can sync your collection and watch status with Trakt. But Kodi was supposed to manage your local files only \u0026mdash; or so I knew.\n\nIf you have a VPS or even a local server with your media files while running Apache or Nginx to serve webpages and/or files, you can actually add those folders as a media source to your Kodi app. The video below will show you how:\n\n***\n\u0026nbsp;\n{{\u003c youtube yREBMpLC4QY \u003e}}\n\u0026nbsp;\n***\n\nOf course, now there are media servers like Plex, Emby and Jellyfin to help you manage and stream your media files.
