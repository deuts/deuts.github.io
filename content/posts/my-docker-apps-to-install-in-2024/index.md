Browsing through [Jim's Garage](https://www.youtube.com/@Jims-Garage) on Youtube, and his [Github repository](https://github.com/JamesTurland/JimsGarage), I was inspired to finally give these Docker apps a try:

- [ ] [Immich](https://github.com/JamesTurland/JimsGarage/tree/main/Immich)
- [ ] [Paperless-ngx](https://github.com/JamesTurland/JimsGarage/tree/main/Paperless-ngx)
- [ ] [Vikunja](https://github.com/JamesTurland/JimsGarage/tree/main/Vikunja)
- [ ] [rClone](https://github.com/JamesTurland/JimsGarage/tree/main/rClone)
- [ ] [Restic](https://github.com/JamesTurland/JimsGarage/tree/main/restic)
